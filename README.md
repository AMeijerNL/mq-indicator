# [Media Query Indicator](https://github.com/AMeijerNL/mq-indicator)
============

A Bookmarklet / CSS Snippet that inserts a Media Query indicator into the page.


## WOKR IN PROGRESS

* THIS IS THE INITIAL COMMIT! STILL NEED TO FIX SOME LINKS AND REFERENCES

## Quick start

1. Go to the [project page](http://dev.ameijer.nl/mq-indicator/index.html)
2. Drag the bookmarklet link to your bookmarks
3. Go to any website 
4. When the page has loaded, select the bookmark you just created
5. There you have it: a Media Query indicator 


## How it works

* The bookmarklet uses Javascript to insert two elements & a small (only 2kb minified!) CSS file into the page
* The selectors (and id's) are well chosen, so it is very unlikely it will overrule any of your existing selectors
* Cross-browser compatible - as long as Media Queries are supported (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE10+).


## Supported formats

* Feature phone size (portrait)
* Phone size (portrait & landscape)
* Tablet size (portrait & landscape)
* Desktop / PC size (landscape)
* Extra Large / TV size (landscape)
